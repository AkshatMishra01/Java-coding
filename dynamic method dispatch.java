Dynamic method dispatch is a mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime. This is how java implements runtime polymorphism. When an overridden method is called by a reference, java determines which version of that method to execute based on the type of object it refer to. In simple words the type of object which it referred determines which version of overridden method will be called.
